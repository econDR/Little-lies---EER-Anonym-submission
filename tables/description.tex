High Dif 					& Binary variable equals to 1 when the absolute difference between red and blue dice observed outcomes in individual roll series is equal to 4 or 5. \\
Low Dif					& Binary variable equals to 1 when the absolute difference between red and blue dice observed outcomes in individual roll series is equal to 1, 2, or 3. Used as omitted reference category in regressions. \\
